# Spider-Verse Graph Analysis

## Overview
This project was developed as part of a Data Structures course at Rutgers University. The assignment focuses on understanding and implementing **Undirected Graphs** and **Adjacency Lists** to model different dimensions in the Spider-Verse. The goal is to analyze the relationships between dimensions, Spider-People, and anomalies using Java.

## Features
- **Graph Representation:** Implements an adjacency list to represent dimensions and their connections.
- **Graph Traversal Algorithms:** Uses BFS and DFS to explore the graph.
- **Shortest Path Calculation:** Determines the shortest path between dimensions.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies misplaced anomalies in incorrect dimensions.

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java  
- **Libraries:** `java.util.*` (No external libraries used)  
- **Input/Output Handling:** Uses `StdIn` and `StdOut` for file-based input and output processing.  

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Spiderverse.git
   cd Spiderverse
